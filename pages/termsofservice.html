<div id="note" class="container column">
	<p>note: my commission prices are NOT set up on this site yet, so for now you'll still have to look <a href="https://vampycat237.carrd.co">at my carrd</a> for those! but below you will find my terms of service, which i've hastily re-written because carrd ate them.</p>
</div>

<div id="1" class="container column" style="text-align: left">
	<h2>1. Definition of Terms</h2>
	<p>"I", "Me", and "(the) Artist" as used in this document refer to Vampycat237.</p>
	<p>"You" and "Client" as used in this document refer to an individual (or group of individuals) who have commissioned a particular Artwork from the Artist.</p>
	<p>"Artwork" refers to the product commissioned by a Client and created by the Artist.</p>
	<p>"Character Design" and "Design" refer to unique character designs created by the Artist, or to the right of ownership over one such character design.</p>
</div>
<div id="2" class="container column" style="text-align: left">
	<h2>2. Rights of the Artist</h2>
	<p>I have the right to refuse service for any reason, and though I will try to provide a reason, I am not obligated to explain any choice to refuse service.</p>
	<p>I have the right to share, publicly or privately, any Artwork I have created for the purpose of promoting my commissions.</p>
	<p>Exceptions include:</p>
	<p>- Should the Client request their Artwork not to be shared publicly, I relinquish said right to share the Artwork publicly.</p>
	<p>- Should the Artwork in question contain adult content, I relinquish the right to share the Artwork publicly, unless the Client gives me explicit permission otherwise.</p>
</div>
<div id="3" class="container column" style="text-align: left">
	<h2>3. Rights of the Client</h2>
	<p>The Client has the right to share, publicly or privately, any piece they have commissioned from the Artist, as long as they credit the Artist as the creator of the piece.</p>
	<p>The Client does not have the right to use any Artwork for a monetary purpose, excluding Character Designs which can be exchanged for goods and/or services by the Owner of the Design.</p>
	<p>If the Client should desire to have the right to use their Artwork for a monetary purpose, they will have to discuss the terms of that agreement with the Artist.</p>
</div>
<div id="4" class="container column" style="text-align: left">
	<h2>4. Communication, Refunds, and Returns</h2>
	<h3>4A. Communication</h3>
	<p>Throughout the duration of the commission process, the Artist will attempt to communicate with the Client at each step (such as sketching, lineart, and coloring). The purpose of these communications is to ensure customer satisfaction, and most importantly to make sure the Artist has not omitted any important details from the Artwork.</p>
	<p>These communications should be expected approximately a month or two apart. I request that Clients do not ask for updates more frequently than once a month.</p>
	<p>If I do not have progress to show, I will still reach out to inform my Clients that I have not forgotten about their commissions.</p>
	
	<h3>4B. Refunds</h3>
	<p>In the event that I do not complete your commission within 12 months of confirming that I will take it, you may request a refund from me.</p>
	<p>The amount of money refunded will depend on how much work has been done on the commission, and will be determined by me based on my listed prices at the time of commissioning. Down payments may not be eligble for refunds.</p>
	<p>If you are refunded for a commission, partially or in full, you will recieve the Artwork as it stands (or nothing, if no work was done), and I will be released from my contractual obligation to complete the piece.</p>
	<p></p>
	
	<h3>4C. Returns</h3>
	<p>Due to the nature of their primarily digital artworks, the Artist does not generally allow returns.</p>
	<p>Exceptions include:</p>
	<p>- Physical products. If you have received a physical product from the Artist, a return may be possible. If you would like to return a physical product, please contact me directly so we can see if we can work something out.</p>
	<p>- Character Designs. I may conditionally accept a return of a Design, if it is one I personally resonate with and if I am financially capable of sending the refund. Returning a Character Design means you forfeit all rights to and ownership of the Character Design.</p>
